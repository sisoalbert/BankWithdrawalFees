# Setting up a React project with Vite

This guide will walk you through the steps of setting up a React project with Vite. Vite is a lightweight development server that makes it easy to build and preview your React app.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js: Vite is built on top of Node.js, so you'll need to have it installed to use Vite. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) or with a package manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
-   Yarn: In this guide, we will be using Yarn as the package manager. If you don't have Yarn installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official website](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

## Step 1: Create a new project

To create a new React project with Vite, run the following command in your terminal:

`yarn create @vitejs/react` 

This will create a new directory with the necessary files and dependencies to get started with Vite and React.

## Step 2: Install dependencies

Next, navigate to the new project directory and install the dependencies by running the following command:

`yarn install` 

This will install all of the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, including React, Vite, and any other necessary packages.

## Step 3: Run the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

`yarn dev` 

This will start the Vite development server, which will automatically rebuild and refresh your app as you make changes. The development server will also start a preview server at `http://localhost:3000`, which you can use to view and test your app in a web browser.

## Step 4: Start building your app

With the development server running, you can now start building your React app. Vite will automatically rebuild and refresh your app as you make changes, so you can see your changes in real-time.

To get started with React, you can create a new component in the `src` directory and import it into the `main.tsx` file. You can then use the component in the `main.tsx` file to render your app.

## Step 5: Build and deploy your app

When you're ready to deploy your app, you can build a production-ready version by running the following command:

`yarn build`
